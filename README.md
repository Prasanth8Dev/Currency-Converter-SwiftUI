**Project Overview**
In this project, I have developed a dynamic and interactive SwiftUI application that showcases various UI components and modifiers to create a rich user experience. The application leverages SwiftUI's powerful and declarative syntax to construct the UI efficiently and intuitively.

**Key Components and Features**

**LazyVGrid, HStack, VStack, ZStack**
Utilized LazyVGrid to display data in a grid format efficiently, optimizing for performance and memory usage.
Employed HStack and VStack to organize UI elements horizontally and vertically, ensuring a clean and structured layout.
Used ZStack to overlay UI elements, enabling the creation of complex and layered designs.

**@State and @Binding**
Implemented @State properties to manage and update local state within views.
Used @Binding to create two-way data binding between parent and child views, allowing seamless data flow and interaction.

**TapGesture**
Integrated TapGesture recognizers to handle user interactions and perform actions when elements are tapped, enhancing the interactivity of the app.


**Enums and Codable**
Defined Enums to represent various states and options within the app.
Conformed to Codable protocol to easily encode and decode data, facilitating smooth data management and storage.

**TextFields and Buttons**
Added TextFields for user input, with custom styling and validation logic.
Created Buttons with custom actions, providing users with the ability to trigger events and navigate through the app.

**Custom Views**
Developed Custom Views to encapsulate reusable UI components, promoting code reusability and modular design.

**@FocusState**
Utilized @FocusState to manage focus on input fields, ensuring a smooth and user-friendly input experience.

**UserDefaults**
Leveraged UserDefaults to persist user settings and data across app launches, providing a consistent and personalized user experience.
